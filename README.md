# 1. numpy-neural-network

A fully customizable neural network implementation using NumPy (pure NumPy).  
It allows flexible configuration of the number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions for each layer.

✅ Fully implemented in **pure NumPy** (no TensorFlow/PyTorch)  
✅ Supports **custom network architectures** with variable layers and activations  
✅ Training using **backpropagation**  
✅ Supports **ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh** activation functions  



# 2. Optimized Neural Network

An improved version with better efficiency:

✅ Mini-Batch Training for faster updates
✅ Vectorized operations for improved performance
✅ He Initialization for stable weight updates
✅ Memory-efficient with np.float32
